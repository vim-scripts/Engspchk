 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
  CVIMSYN : points to a directory holding the user word database <usr_engspchk.vim>
            The optional file <wb1913_engspchk.vim>, which contains words
			from Webster's 1913 Dictionary that aren't in engspchk itself,
			if present in the CVIMSYN directory, will also be loaded.

 INCLUDED MAPS
  \et : add  word under cursor into database (temporarily - ie. just this file)
  \es : save word under cursor into database (permanently)  (requires $CVIMSYN)
  \en : move cursor to the next     spelling error
  \ep : move cursor to the previous spelling error
  \ea : look for alternative spellings of word under cursor

 MAPS FOR ALTERNATIVES WINDOW ONLY
  <cr> : on alternatives line, will put word under cursor in
         searchword's stead
  :q   : will quit the alternate-word window
  
  In order to generate alternatives engspchk uses agrep, source code for which
  can be found at:   ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/text/agrep-2.04.tar.Z
  Windows binary at: http://www.tgries.de/agrep

 USAGE
  Simply source the file in.  It does *not* do a "syntax clear", so that means
  that you can usually just source it in on top of other highlighting.

  In order to spell-check comments in various languages, the language's
  vim syntax file needs to have its comment syntax group contain a cluster.
  Engspchk can then add itself to that cluster.  The vim syntax languages
  that currently support this include:

	amiga           c               dcl             latex           tex
	bash            cpp             fortran         sh              vim
	bib             csh             ksh

  If there's a language for which you'd like to have comments spelling-checked
  that isn't on the above list, please contact that vim syntax file's maintainer
  and ask for the support mentioned above.

 OTHER LANGUAGES
  There are versions of this script for other languages.  If you come
  up with a version for another language, please let me know where on
  the web it is so that I can help make it known.

  CREATING YOUR OWN LANGUAGE SPELLING CHECKER
   There is also a create script (http://jeanluc-picard.de/vim/gerspchk/create)
   that uses the Bourne shell to merge engspchk with a dictionary.  You can
   often find a dictionary (actually, its just a word list) on the web.
   Please let me know if you create such a script and make it available on
   the web so that I can mention it to others.
